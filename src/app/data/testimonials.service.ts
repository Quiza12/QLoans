            'We found David extremely knowledgeable and easy to deal with.',
            'My husband and I were referred to David as we were in the market for a new mortgage broker. We found David extremely knowledgeable and easy to deal with. He came to visit us at our convenience and after many setbacks, remained patient and reassured us that we would get there. We would have no hesitation in recommending him to our family and friends. David, thank you once again for being there each step of the way. You\'re now saving our family hundreds of dollars per month so we can\'t thank you enough for all of your home loan advice.'),

            'David is by far the most helpful and informative mortgage broker we\'ve had the pleasure of dealing with which is why we\'ve stuck with him and the team for the last five years through preparation of an owner home home, then renegotiating a better rate, top-up and now working on an investment loan. He has always has given good advice and found us the best lenders and rates.'),

            'I would recommend anyone to come and seek their advice on getting a better home loan rate especially first home buyers who maybe unsure of what to do.',
            'David and Joanne have now helped my wife and I through two home loans and have been the best mortgage brokers we have used. Being novices at home loans, David gave us great financial advice when it came to renewing our home loan with lots of choices from different lenders. When it came to purchasing our new home, David helped us with the process of settling a bridging loan and negotiating the best rate with our current lender. Without David and Joanne\'s financial expertise we would not have been able to be in the position we are today and are extremely grateful for all their help. I would recommend anyone to come and seek their advice on getting a better home loan rate especially first home buyers who maybe unsure of what to do. David is extremely knowledgeable and he and his wife made the process so much easier to understand and more importantly, were there every step of the way.'),

            'We were referred to David and Joanne for our home loan needs and financial advice. We quickly realised that we had gone to the right mortgage broker as their professionalism, knowledge and work ethic became apparent. They have since also negotiated our construction loan and we are well on the way to completing our home. Thank you for all the hard work and look forward to working with you on our next project.'),

            'Frankly, I was hugely impressed by David\'s ability to get the job done, with good humour and professionalism throughout.',
            'David recently worked for me on a complex business finance requirement, one that required turning over a lot of stones and leg work on this part. Frankly, I was hugely impressed by David\'s ability to get the job done, with good humour and professionalism throughout. I\'d highly recommend David and Jo for "outside the box" finance requirements - David\'s business finance background means he is far more than a "mortgage broker". Highly recommended.'),

            '...even with us being self employed he was able get us good options and rates for both construction loans and land loans...',
            'David and his team did a great job at preparing home loan options for us, even with us being self employed he was able get us good options and rates for both construction loans and land loans this along with his financial advice means we are able to start construction of our dream home!'),

            'David\'s professionalism, communication and customer service was over and above during the entire process.',
            'David worked with us on a tricky loan to secure finance for a company vehicle. Securing a great deal on the car we found meant that David had to organise our new finance while dealing with a car that was still encumbered on the sellers end. The process was fiddly and complicated and considering the loan amount was modest in the scheme of things, it was definitely more trouble than it was worth at times! Regardless, David\'s professionalism, communication and customer service was over and above during the entire process. I was always kept personally updated by phone and email on what was happening. The final call from David to confirm we were settled was a relief for all. The outcome for us is a fantastic new company vehicle that was purchased at an amazing prize for the extra features and immaculate condition it was presented in. This outcome could not have been achieved without David. He genuinely wanted to help us secure this opportunity and pushed the process constantly until the deal was done. If you are looking for an experienced broker that will work with you as a person and not a number, QLoans is the place to go.'),
